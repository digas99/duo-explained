# Duo Explained Mobile

Duo Explained is a Browser Extension. It is not directly available for mobile devices (much less the Duolingo Mobile App).

However, you can still use it on your mobile device by using a browser that supports extensions. In this guide, we will be using [Kiwi Browser](https://kiwibrowser.com/) as an example, but you should be able to use any browser that supports extensions.

Because the Duolingo Web App is a Progressive Web App (PWA), it will feel like you are using the Duolingo Mobile App.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Duo Explained on your mobile device:

## Extension Installation

1. Install Kiwi Browser from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser).

2. Open Kiwi Browser, go to the Chrome Web Store and install [Duo Explained](#).

3. Open the Duo Explained extension from the Browser Menu and setup your OpenAI API key (as you would on a desktop browser - [see here](docs/help/API_KEY.md)).

	</div>

## Duolingo App

1. Open the Duolingo Web App on Kiwi Browser.



2. On the Browser Menu, click on `Add to Home screen`.

	<div style="gap: 10px; display: flex;">

	</div>

3. It sould now be available on your home screen, and if you open it from there, it will feel like you are using the Duolingo Mobile App (it will never be the same as the actual Duolingo Mobile App because it is limited to what features the Duolingo team implements in the browser version, but it is still a very good and complete experience).
