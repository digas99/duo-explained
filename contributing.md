# Contributing to Duolingo ChatGPT

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Duolingo ChatGPT**! It's people like you that make Duolingo ChatGPT such a great tool to increase your language skills.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

# Pull requests
**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a feature request to first discuss any new ideas. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features, please include tests.

## Introduction

We love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving documentation, submitting bug reports, feature requests, or even writing code that can be incorporated into **Duolingo ChatGPT**.

Feel free to use the issue tracker for support questions

## Ground Rules

- **Be Respectful**: This project adheres to a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create issues for any major changes and get community feedback.
  - Keep feature versions small.
- **Testing**: Ensure that your changes are tested.

## Your First Contribution

If you are new to contributing to open-source projects, we recommend starting by looking through these beginner-friendly issues:

- **Beginner Issues**: Issues which require only a few lines of code and a test or two.
- **Help Wanted Issues**: More involved issues that require additional expertise.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

## Getting Started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** with your changes.
3. Ensure that your code follows the current code style and tests have been added.
4. Submit a pull request.

### Small or Obvious Fixes
Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

- Spelling / grammar fixes
- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean up
- Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
- Adding logging messages or debugging output
- Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
- Moving source files from one directory or package to another


## How to Report a Bug

If you find a security vulnerability, **do not** open an issue. Instead, email us directly at **andreclerigo@outlook.com** or **digas_correia@hotmail.com**.

To file a bug report:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue and include:
   - Your operating system and version.
   - What you did.
   - What you expected to see.
   - What you actually saw.

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

If you have a feature you'd like to see, open an issue to describe:

1. **The feature you would like** to see.
2. **Why you need it**.
3. **How it should work**.

We value features that align with our project philosophy: lightweight, robust, and versatile.

## Code Review Process

After submitting a pull request:

- The core team will review your contribution.
- Expect feedback within two weeks.
- We may close pull requests that do not show activity after two weeks.

## Community

- **[Discussion Forum](#)** - Open for general questions and help.
